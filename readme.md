# MicroFE - A minimalistic frontend

## About

Micro FE is an incredibly simple emulator frontend.

## Features (lack of features)

* **No Artwork!** - Yup, that's right. This frontend is text only. And it's not even very good text.

* **No Graphics!** - MicroFE uses straight up `System.Drawing` which means it's portable. Every OS has a monospace font.
